Instructions for LVGL setup on PSOC 6 Cy8kit-062-BLE with CY8CKIT-028-TFT

Firstly you can follow the example LVGL project here on github
https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-lvgl-demo

1.) This explains that Modulus Toolbox is needed to get the example project and be able to run the LVGL_Demo project. 

2.) Once created in the top level of the project folder structure create a folder named ui. This should be on the same level as the source folder.

3.) Once that is ready I used Squareline studio to make my UI. To import that in you will need to go into 
Squareline studio -> Your project or an example one -> Export -> Export to the example project in Modulus toolbox to the ui folder

Now you will need to do some configurations. 

4.) Firstly go into the source folder -> tft_task.c -> tft_task function. In there you will see a function called lv_demo_music(). Comment this out
since this is the demo project stuff and in place of that we will put ui_init() this will be our new ui project.

5.) In the same file #include "../ui/ui.h"

6.) Finally if you build and get errors with it not recognizing the new ui files you might have to adjust the include statement in ui -> ui.h
I got errors and my include was #include "lvgl/lvgl.h" I had to make it "lvgl" and I also had to change one of the fontsizes from 18 to 16. 

Once that is all fixed you should be good to go but you might have some errors. Just try to fix those small errors.
